The packaging is good and print quality is good with a couple caveats. There’s a bit of elephant foot and inconsistent extrusion. The elephant foot is only on one of them, the model has a small chamfer to help prevent the elephant foot. This is a print-in-place model and clearances  are generous at 0.3mm to 1mm. The bottom finish is glossy flat (likely from a glass bed). However, it appears the first couple of layers had some fluctuations in flow rate and that caused a tight fusion of parts that needed some extra force to break apart and that process resulted in some surfaces looking jagged and rough.  The model has a couple thin parts and they lifted off the print bed in 3 of the 4 areas. The impact was minimal, but noticeable on the bottom of the print. The top layers were good overall, but there are areas of under-extrusion— could also be the result of the slicer used. I like the light gray color and think it’s a great choice for functional and creative designs.

The Phone_Holder_x2.stl was used in the API request to get a sample print.
